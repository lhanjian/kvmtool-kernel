 Installation instructions for kvmtool
---------------------------------------

==========================================================================
For the impatient:
Just typing "make" should do the trick most of the times.
You will get a binary called "lkvm" which is self-contained.
No extra libraries or files need to be installed.
==========================================================================

Prerequisites
--------------
For compilation you will need a recent GNU tool chain (binutils, gcc, make),
also the standard C library.

	Libraries
	-------------------
- vncserver: enable support for exporting the guest framebuffer in a VNC session
- SDL: enable support for displaying the guest framebuffer in a SDL window
- zlib: enable support for compressed QCOW images
- aio: enable support for asynchronous I/O
So for the full glory you would need:
(on a .deb based system):
$ sudo apt-get install binutils-dev libvncserver-dev libsdl2-dev \
		       zlib1g-dev libaio-dev
(on RPM based systems):
# $TOOL install binutils-devel libvncserver-devel SDL-devel \
	      zlib-devel libaio-devel
$TOOL is "yum" for Fedora and "zypper" for OpenSUSE.
